# ComplexSky 2.0
## Overview
The aim of this project is to create software that would realistically generate an image of a sky. This includes:
- Stars (point lights)
- Space objects (texture objects)
- Atmospheric ambience
- Clouds
## Improvements upon ComplexSky 1.0
- Move from RGB spectrum to a multitude of custom spectrums, which can be converted to one another
- Usage of 0 to 1 scale of spectrum level has been replaced with raw data, the values of which can be custom set
- Major refactors to the code structure
- Added textured objects support
